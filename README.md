BK-0010 Emulator

## What it can do
* Emulate [BK-0010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK)

## Third party software
This project uses several libraries:
* (GPL v3.0) Display video using VGA, process PS/2 keyboard, and sound output: https://github.com/fdivitto/FabGL
* (unsure, MIT?) PDP-11 emulator: https://github.com/emestee/bk-emulator

## Plans for the future / issues
* Load file in .BIN format from SD card
* Save snapshot
* Measure emulation speed and see if it needs a slowdown
* Sound
